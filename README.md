# Quest Hall

## Overview

Quest Hall is a centralized game library application that allows gamers to organize and manage their video game collections across multiple platforms in one convenient location. Users can create an account, build their personal game collection, and view all their games at a glance—eliminating the need to jump between different platforms and stores.

## Problem Statement

Gamers today own games across multiple platforms (PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, etc.). Currently, there's no centralized place to view and manage an entire game collection. Players have to jump between different platforms and stores to remember what they own, making it difficult to keep track of their libraries and organize their games.

## Solution

Quest Hall solves this by providing a single, unified platform where users can:
- Create an account and log in securely
- Manually add games to their personal collection
- Specify which platform they own each game on
- Categorize games as Single Player, Multiplayer, or Co-op
- View their entire game library across all platforms
- Edit game information in their collection
- Delete games from their library
- Mark games as favorites for quick access
- **(Stretch Goal)** Join a tavern with friends to see which multiplayer games everyone owns and easily decide what to play together

## Features
